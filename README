Chemistry/File/MDLMol version 0.22
Chemistry/File/SDF    version 0.22
==================================

This modules read MDL mol and SDF (structure data file) files. 

The MDLmol module automatically registers the 'mdl' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that molfiles may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol::read_mol().
The SDF module registers the 'sdf' format.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.21
        - Implemented reading and writing of isotopes (bug 134837)
        - Fixed typo in documentation.
